# Facial-Attribute-Prediction-with-Custom-CNN-and-ResNet50
This repository implements facial attribute prediction using two architectures: a custom CNN model and transfer learning with ResNet50. The custom CNN provides flexibility in feature extraction, while ResNet50 leverages pretrained weights from ImageNet for enhanced accuracy in predicting age, gender, and race based on facial images.

## Key Features:

- **Custom CNN Architecture:** Designed for explicit control over feature extraction and model design.
- **ResNet50 Transfer Learning:** Utilizes pretrained weights for improved performance with minimal data.
- **Multi-Output Prediction:** Predicts age (regression), gender, and race (classification) simultaneously.
