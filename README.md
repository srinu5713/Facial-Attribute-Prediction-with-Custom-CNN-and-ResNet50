# Facial-Attribute-Prediction-with-Custom-CNN-and-ResNet50
This repository showcases facial attribute prediction using a custom CNN model and transfer learning with ResNet50. The custom CNN allows flexible feature extraction, while ResNet50 utilizes pretrained ImageNet weights for accurate age, gender, and race prediction from facial images.
